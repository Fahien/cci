In the interest of consistency across our examples, please use the following
doxygen commenting guidelines.  References come from:
  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html#docstructure
where more detailed information can be found.

- Use the JavaDoc style:
  /**
   * ... text ...
   */

- Use the following format for single line briefs:
  /// Brief description.a

- Use the following format for documentation after members:
  int var; ///< Brief description after the member

- Use '@' command tags vs. '\'

General guideline: avoid styles that use '!'.

Provide at least the following commands:
- file: @file, @brief, @author
- class: @class, @brief 
- class methods: @fn, @brief, @param, @return, @exception
- sc_main function: @fn, @brief, @param, @return
Detailed descriptions are encouraged when warranted.

Please send an inquiry to the [cciwg] email reflector regarding any areas that
require further clarification.
