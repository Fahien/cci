NOTE :  The following example ex7_Parameter_Information has been tested on Linux OS only

1.  Within the example ex7_Parameter_Information directory, find
    
    a.  Documentation/Presentation within "docs" sub-directory
    
    b.  Expected output within the "reports" sub-directory



2.  Objective:  To demonstrate the following :

    a.	Modeler perspective: Model-to-Model Configuration (UC12)
    
    b.	Default Values and Initial Values (UC3)
  
    c.	Name-Based Parameter Access (R1.3)
 
    An assessment of how well this emulates OVM-SC configuration is also to be documented.

3.  TLM2.0 communication has been embedded just in order to make (master, router) and (router, slave)
    communicate to each-other.  The example doesn't specify to demonstrate TLM2.0.  Hence, the TLM2
    communication log within the 'expected.log' file can be ignored.
