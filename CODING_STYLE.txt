We are following Philipp's recommendations (from 
https://github.com/OSCI-WG/cci/pull/17) to achieve consistency with other 
SystemC standards:

- Generally follow Google C++ style guide
  (Over time we will note critical exceptions in this document.)
- naming all lower-case, separated by underscores
- nested typedefs with `_type`
- base classes ending with `_base` (or `_b`)

We also agreed (in 3/16/2015 WG meeting) to use:
- 'get_' prefix for all getters
- 'set_' prefix for all setters
This varies slightly from the SystemC norm but we felt strict uniformity was
more important.
