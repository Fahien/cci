1) What's new in this release?
==============================

TLM2 and SystemC regressions are now combined into this single suite.

Compatibility across different platforms has been greatly improved.

Improved coverage of SystemC features, including new IEEE Std 1666-2011 regression tests.


2) Bug fixes and enhancements
=============================

This is a summary of the main changes:

  - Combined SystemC regressions and TLM2 Unit Tests into a single structure.
  
  - Improved include structure.
  
  - Regression script verify.pl now tested on many platforms, so multiple copies of the 
    script have been removed.


3) Other changes
================

Here is an overview of changes with respect to the previous release:

================================================================================
*** [Swami] Inserting my release notes here!

  - Breaking changes in verify.pl
    o SYSTEMC_TEST environment variable now should include the trailing (tests/ or examples/) path too.
    o verify.pl was not stripping the header line - 'SystemC Simulation' in output log. This is fixed. 
    (Existing systemc-regression golden logs need to strip this extra line at beginning).

  - New Environment Variables
    o CCI_HOME: CCI home directory path
    o BOOST_HOME: Boost home directory path
    o A sample CCI examples/ build source file is given below:

-- [ cci_env.bash ]
export SYSTEMC_HOME=/vobs/ti_systemc/tools/systemc/systemc-2.3.0
export BOOST_HOME=/vobs/ti_systemc/tools/boost/boost_1_44_0
export CCI_HOME=/proj/sds_cce/cci_ti/cci
# export SYSTEMC_PTHREADS=1
export SYSTEMC_TEST=${CCI_HOME}/examples
export CXX=g++
# export PATH=/apps/free/gcc/4.4.5/bin:${PATH}
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/apps/free/gcc/4.4.5/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
--

  - Note: Tested on RHEL4/gcc-4.4/64-bit platform

================================================================================

4) Known limitations
====================

Here is a list of known limitations in this release:

  - Not all options of the verify.pl script are fully functional.

  - The regression test suite does not cover all the SystemC source code,
    though it is improved compared to previous versions.

  - Some datatype tests take a long time to either compile or run.

  - On Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), the verify.pl script does not
    detect the x86_64 architecture correctly. You can run the
    regressions against a 32-bit version of SystemC.
