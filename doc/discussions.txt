1.2 post_read callbacks?

post_read callback discussion: We currently do NOT provide post_read callbacks since they are very hard to define and implement.

1.1 cci_value implementation/definition

An interesting point is how and where to implement the cci_value thing, which allows to set and get values in a generic way.

Options are 
a/ make it an interface (cci_value), which needs to be implemented by
   a vendor (like gs_cci_value, as done for cci_param), or 
b/ if to implement it directly in the standard header files (which
   means no vendor specific implementation for the cci_value at all) - or 
c/ define the class and let the vendor implement the functions
   (not another class that implements the interface)


a/   (-) results in vendor dependent code (like needed for cci_params,
         too).
     (+) most flexible for implementation
b/c/ (+) allow the user/application code to use cci_value directly, 
b/   (-) not flexible at all
c/   (-) less flexible, since the standard must define the complete class
         and class members, which cannot be changed by the implementation
         any more
